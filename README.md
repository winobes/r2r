My first attempt at a GTK+3 program.  It's a simple interface I made for my brother to log his workouts, but it could be used for just about anything... Just kidding.  It's not at all customizable.  Nevertheless, feel free to distribute, reuse, critique, scrach your head over, etc. all or any part of the code with or without attribution.  The source for this project and the amature CSV library it depends on can be found on my [github](https://github.com/robertpostill/libCSV) page. As always:
